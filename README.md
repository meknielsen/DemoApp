# Sailsjs App

A small project to learn Sailsjs from. Code is being written in Cloud9 online IDE, and other of my platforms for fun:

- Raspberry PI v2
- Raspberry Zero
- Solus VM 

Sails.js is a very powerfull MVC javascript framework, making very it easy to build custom, 
enterprise-grade Node.js apps.
