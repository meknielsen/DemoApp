# Sailsjs App

A small project to learn Sailsjs from. Code is being written in Cloud9 online IDE, and other of my platforms for fun:

- Raspberry PI v2
- Raspberry Zero
- Solus VM 

[Sails.js](https://sailsjs.org) is a very powerfull MVC javascript framework, making it very easy to build custom, 
enterprise-grade Node.js apps. Sails is built on Node.js, uses Express for handling HTTP requests, 
and wraps socket.io for managing WebSockets.
